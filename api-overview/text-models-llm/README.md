# Text Models (LLM)

## Overview

The AI/ML API provides access to text-based models, also known as Large Language Models (LLMs), and allows you to interact with them through natural language. These models can be applied to various tasks, enabling the creation of diverse applications using our API.

For example, text models can be used to:

* Create a system that searches your photos using text prompts.
* Act as a psychological supporter.
* Play games with you through natural language.
* Assist you with coding.
* Perform a security assessment (pentest) on servers for vulnerabilities.
* Write documentation for your services.
* Serve as a grammar corrector for multiple languages with deep context understanding.
* And much more.

We support numerous Large Language Models. You can view the complete list of models in our database.
