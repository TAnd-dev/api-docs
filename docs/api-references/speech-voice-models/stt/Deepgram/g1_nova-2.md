# Model Overview
Nova-2 builds on the advancements of Nova-1 with speech-specific optimizations to its Transformer architecture, refined data curation techniques, and a multi-stage training approach. These improvements result in a lower word error rate (WER) and better entity recognition (including proper nouns and alphanumeric sequences), as well as enhanced punctuation and capitalization.

Nova-2 offers the following model options:
general: Optimized for everyday audio processing.
meeting: Optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone.
phonecall: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.
voicemail: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio clips with a single speaker. Derived from the phonecall model.
finance: Optimized for multiple speakers with varying audio quality, such as might be found on a typical earnings call. Vocabulary is heavily finance oriented.
conversationalai: Optimized for use cases in which a human is talking to an automated bot, such as IVR, a voice assistant, or an automated kiosk.
video: Optimized for audio sourced from videos.
medical: Optimized for audio with medical oriented vocabulary.
drivethru: Optimized for audio sources from drivethrus.
automotive: Optimized for audio with automative oriented vocabulary.
atc: Optimized for audio from air traffic control.
