{% endhint %}

# Model Overview
An advanced AI model that generates diverse high-quality audio compositions by analyzing and reproducing musical patterns, rhythms, and vocal styles from the reference track. Refine the process using a text prompt.

Warning: This model is deprecated (or planned for deprecation) and may no longer receive updates or support. We recommend switching to music-01 MiniMax model, which offers improved performance and ongoing support. The recommended alternative is faster, more cost-efficient, and supports an extended set of parameters compared to this model.
