# Model Overview
Nova-2 builds on the advancements of Nova-1 with speech-specific optimizations to its Transformer architecture, refined data curation techniques, and a multi-stage training approach.

- **atc**: Optimized for audio from air traffic control.

- **conversationalai**: Optimized for use cases in which a human is talking to an automated bot, such as IVR, a voice assistant, or an automated kiosk.
- **drivethru**: Optimized for audio sources from drivethrus.
- **finance**: Optimized for multiple speakers with varying audio quality, such as might be found on a typical earnings call. Vocabulary is heavily finance oriented.
- **general**: Optimized for everyday audio processing.
- **medical**: Optimized for audio with medical oriented vocabulary.
- **meeting**: Optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone.
- **phonecall**: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls.
