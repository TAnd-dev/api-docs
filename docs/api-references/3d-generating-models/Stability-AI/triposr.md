# Model Overview
Nova-2 builds on the advancements of Nova-1 with speech-specific optimizations to its Transformer architecture, refined data curation techniques, and a multi-stage training approach. These improvements result in a lower word error rate (WER) and better entity recognition (including proper nouns and alphanumeric sequences), as well as enhanced punctuation and capitalization. &lt;br/&gt; Nova-2 offers the following model options: &lt;br/&gt; - **atc**: Optimized for audio from air traffic control. &lt;br/&gt; - **automotive**: Optimized for audio with automative oriented vocabulary. &lt;br/&gt; - **conversationalai**: Optimized for use cases in which a human is talking to an automated bot, such as IVR, a voice assistant, or an automated kiosk. &lt;br/&gt;- **drivethru**: Optimized for audio sources from drivethrus. &lt;br/&gt;- **finance**: Optimized for multiple speakers with varying audio quality, such as might be found on a typical earnings call. Vocabulary is heavily finance oriented. &lt;br/&gt; - **general**: Optimized for everyday audio processing. &lt;br/&gt; - **medical**: Optimized for audio with medical oriented vocabulary. &lt;br/&gt; - **meeting**: Optimized for conference room settings, which include multiple speakers with a single microphone. &lt;br/&gt; - **phonecall**: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio phone calls. &lt;br/&gt; - **video**: Optimized for audio sourced from videos. &lt;br/&gt; - **voicemail**: Optimized for low-bandwidth audio clips with a single speaker. Derived from the phonecall model.
