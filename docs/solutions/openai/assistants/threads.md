# Thread API

**Threads** serve as conversation containers that store messages exchanged between a user and an assistant, maintaining context and continuity across interactions.

This page provides API schemas for the following methods:

* [Create a thread](threads.md#create-a-thread)
* [Retrieve information about a specific thread by its ID](threads.md#retrieve-information-about-a-specific-thread-by-its-id)
* [Modify a specific thread by its ID](threads.md#modify-a-specific-thread-by-its-id)
* [Delete a specific thread by its ID](threads.md#delete-a-specific-thread-by-its-id)

After each schema, you'll find a short example demonstrating how to correctly call the described method in code using the OpenAI SDK.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note that the method names in the API schema and the SDK often differ.\
Accordingly, when calling these methods via the REST API, you should use the names from the API schema, while for calls through the OpenAI SDK, use the names from the examples.
{% endhint %}

## API Schemas

### Create a thread

{% openapi src="https://api.aimlapi.com/docs-public-yaml?key=2b878a3c71a785f13366e9be96bacb29" path="/threads" method="post" %}
[https://api.aimlapi.com/docs-public-yaml?key=2b878a3c71a785f13366e9be96bacb29](https://api.aimlapi.com/docs-public-yaml?key=2b878a3c71a785f13366e9be96bacb29)
{% endopenapi %}

#### Example: Create a thread

```python
thread = client.beta.threads.create(
  messages=[

      "content": "Create 3 data visualizations based on the trends in this file.",
      "attachments": [
        {
          "file_id": file.id,
          "tools": [{"type": "code_interpreter"}]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
)
